# Documentation

The documentation for this project is divided into sections.

There are two main categories: one describing how to build the OS image,
how to use the main script of the repository and how to change the
building process to customize the resulting image; another category to
describe how to use the Linux distribution.

Some other pages then complete the documentation.
